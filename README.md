## Overview

I have been a [Gunbot](https://gunthy.org/gunbot/) community member since 2019 and decided to help the community out with a need of a standardized containizered app of Gunbot for an easy to run setup.

This setup will allow for a vanilla, Gunbot setup, in less than a minute, allowing fully customizations, while providing one with the latest version, at all times.
